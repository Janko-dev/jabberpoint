# Jabberpoint
Jabberpoint is a slide show presentation tool developed for the master course Design for Change at the Open University. The project is meant to demonstrate the process of creating software in a future-proof way, by using an agreed upon ubiquitous language, applying common Object-Oriented design patterns, and following several design principles.

## getting started
The **main** method is located in _src/Main/Main.java_. Run this file to build and execute the .class files. The Examples folder contains a demo slideshow that is loaded at the start of the application. Java 8 SDK is used for this project.
